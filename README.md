### PDF Order template
Basically, the module will get the precise information on the order, and inform it on the PDF file without any flaws. Even if you have some custom fields on the checkout page but you have no idea if it can be printed on the PDF files, no worries, it will be. After consumers place their orders, this PDF Order file will be included in the email confirmation automatically.  

In the backend demo, make your way to ``Mageplaza > PDF Invoices: Manage Templates``. Choose **Edit** for **Default PDF Order**. The form will be displayed and now you can make any customization in designing template as you want.

### PDF Shipment template
No one wishes their merchandises to be lost on the way, so delivery information should be taken into account carefully at the first place. If our module can mirror accurately shipping information on the printable file? Absolutely, this ease one will be the one size fits all. You can experience its compatibility that includes both Shipping Address and Billing Address on the paper amazingly.

First, you can preview and edit the template at ``Mageplaza > PDF Invoices: Manage Template``, choose to edit the **Default PDF Shipment** file.

Similar to the feature in the template for PDF Invoice and PDF Order, variables for Barcode and QR code also can be accepted here. You can take this advantage to enrich more information for your invoice more than it’s supposed.

### PDF Credit Memo template
As far as you know, a credit memo (or credit memorandum) is a special type of document that is really helpful in the accounting system. In case of not being able to receive merchandises at the best status, and instead of giving the refund back to buyers, sellers will issue a credit memo which is written the details of the order, dealt pricings or some additional notes. And this document can be used to reduce or eliminate entirely the total amount buyers have to pay off.

To configure an automatic sending credit memo, take a look at how your file will be previewed, the premade template is placed in ``Mageplaza > PDF Invoices: Manage Template > Default PDF Credit Memo``.
